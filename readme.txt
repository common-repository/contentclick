== Frequently Asked Questions ==

How does ContentClick work?

ContentClick provides bloggers with a sponsored content widget that integrates into their blog to provide a revenue stream from users that click and engage with the content.

Why should I use ContentClick?

ContentClick is a simple, engaging way to make money from your blog offering high quality content with competitive earnings. ContentClick is the UK’s fastest growing native ad delivery system with a growing network of bloggers, and is always happy to help you with any questions.

Is it free?

Yes, our widget is completely free for bloggers to install.

How do I generate income?

ContentClick generates revenue by selling clicks to advertisers. Advertisers pay us a premium for the service, and we share all the revenue generated with bloggers on a 60/40 split (in your favour). To generate income, users need to engage with our sponsored content widget and click through to one of many high quality articles featured on the ContentClick network. 

How do I get paid?

We pay our bloggers monthly via PayPal to keep things as simple as possible – you just have to enter your PayPal email address.

Is there a minimum amount  I have to earn before getting paid?

No, there is no minimum. We work with bloggers of all sizes and you start earning straight away.

How long does it take my website to be approved?

Once you have submitted your application, our support team will verify your domain in 24 hours. (You will be able to access the control panel in the meantime but you won’t start making money until you are verified.)

What blog categories work best?

We have 7 key categories that the advertisements work best on:
Parenting ; Fashion ; Student Life ; Travel ; Current Affairs ; Sport ; Food & Drink

What type of content will be displayed on the widget?

ContentClick displays relevant content to achieve the highest click through rate. Our content ranges across all areas, including health, beauty, fashion, fitness, finance, home and more.

Can I choose the content?

Our widget works by selecting the most relevant and best performing content for your site, but if you see anything that isn’t quite right for you, then visit your ContentClick account, click on the ‘Content’ section and use the search bar to find any content you wish to block. 

Does ContentClick work in any country?

Currently, ContentClick only works in the UK but we are expanding throughout 2014.

How do I install the widget on my website?

Once you create an account you can customise your widget in your ContentClick account. Once you have chosen your settings you can generate JavaScript code that you can copy and paste into your blog. We also have a free WordPress plugin for anyone using Wordpress.org
Here is a step by step guide to setting up the widget using WordPress.org: http://www.contentclick.co.uk/support-wordpress.php
Here is a step by step guide to setting up the widget using Blogger: http://www.contentclick.co.uk/support-blogger.php

Does it matter where I place the widget?

Yes! We always recommend placing the widget at the bottom of your blog posts, just above the comments section. This is where the widget performs best.  

Will it work on my blog?

Our widget will work across all websites and blogging sites, such as Blogger, Blogspot and Wordpress.org. (Unfortunately it will not work on Wordpress.com blogs as they do not allow any 3rd party advertising on their sites.)

Can I customise the widget?

Yes, you can customise your widget in your ContentClick account. You have full control to specify:
- number of content links 
- image size
- widget title

Can I speak to someone if I have a question?
